# KittyCatGalactica
Final Project for CSC 165: Computer Game Architecture and Implementation F20:

Development started as the final assignment of CSC 165, the Computer Game Architecture and Implementation course at CSUS, and 
resulted in **KittyCatGalactica**, a competitive third-person, multiplayer item collection game. Primarily written in Java and 
javascript, two players connect via server-client UDP connection once an IP address is provided. 

Gameplay begins when each player is assigned to either side of the field of play. Players then set out to increase their score 
by collecting items. Once a player reached the goal score, that player wins the game. More information can be found in the Player's
Guide document located in this directory.
